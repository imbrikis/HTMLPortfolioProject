  	<h3>The things that I do</h3>
  	<p>I am a Network Engineer. What is that exactly? Well, along with keeping the blinky lights a-blinkin', I identify the needs of my customers and present the best solution that fits their budget and needs. I also work to maintain those networks and address any problems or concerns that may arise. My career evolved from running low-voltage cabling throughout new construction projects, into a transition into computer troubleshooting, and eventually into the higher virtual layers of computer networks. It would seem logical that my next progression would be into the realm of coding. Over the past couple years, I've been working toward becoming a full-stack web developer. I enjoy coding in Javascript the most, but I am also capable of coding in other languages and frameworks. Outside of my career, I dabble in audio recording and composition.</p>
